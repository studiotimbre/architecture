<h3>Rachmaninoff&#39;s compelling interpretations</h3>

<p>Critics &amp; fellow musicians recognized Rachmaninoff&#39;s skill in shaping momentary nuances towards a broad interpretive arc – creating a sense of coherence and potency. Below are a few of their impressions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have the impression of the greatest sincerity always in his works, and although they are often complex, it is an organized complexity, and it is this which produces the effect of simplicity... <strong>Every note counts. Every note is inspired by feeling.</strong>&quot; (Stokowski in Etude 1919)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;performances of the Beethoven sonatas, particularly of the Appassionata and the Waldstein, as incomparably grand. Even here <strong>Rachmaninoff stamped his own personality on the works he played, making them seem as if he had composed them himself.</strong>&quot; (Martyn 1990)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The magic <strong>unfolding of the musical form</strong> under his hands, the magnificent effortless <strong>grandeur of his tone</strong>, the <strong>flexibility of his phrasing</strong>, the superb <strong>vigor of his rhythmic delivery</strong>—all these diversified qualities and attainments combine to produce a unique <strong>impression of complete musical mastery</strong>, as restful as it is imposing, as emotional as it is euphonius&quot; (Grainger in Etude 1919).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rachmaninoff&#39;s playing is distinguished by its clarity. He is far from being a dry analyst, but he <strong>delights in exposing the structure of a work in an eloquent manner. In this he has no rival.</strong>&quot; (H. T. Parker in Bertensson 1956, 224)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Frequently, composers write in order to be able to play... <strong>Rachmaninoff plays because he has composed.</strong>&quot; (<em>Boston Evening Transcript</em> 1909)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>always the most ardent, serious student, and a tireless worker</strong>; never satisfied with himself and his achievements. A severe critic of his own work, hence a really great man.&quot; (Hoffman in Etude 1919).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rachmaninoff... brought a <strong>composer&#39;s mind</strong> to bear upon performance... <strong>re-creation</strong>&quot; (Kolodin in Cunningham 2001)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An N. Weinberg, writing in the Washington Herald, had noted: &quot;Composers seldom play well. Absorbed by their own creative work, they seldom have time or inclination for painstaking, conscientious recreation of other men&#39;s works.&quot; Yet, Sergei Bertensson and Jay Leyda state: &quot;<strong>All the demands he made on himself in playing his own compositions were multiplied in playing the work of others.</strong>&quot; Bringing to his performances the mind of a composer, <strong>Rachmaninoff insisted upon deconstructing each work he played to discover and gain a profound understanding of its essence.</strong> Colleagues recall that he would learn a new piece by playing it up to <strong>twenty times slower than written and sounding each chord repeatedly up and down the keyboard.</strong> Harold Schonberg called him the great builder, who <strong>emphasized the architectural splendor and inexorable logic in each piece through a colossal technique in which rhythmic thrust, sonority and phrasing were shaped with virility and exquisite finish.</strong>&quot; (Gutmann 2007).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;something legendary... something epic in the <strong>power and force of his conceptions</strong>&quot; (A review quoted in Cunningham 2001)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He is not one of the composers who, having a <strong>masterly command</strong> of musical utterance, have nothing in particular to utter... It is much to be able to set down musical ideas with absolute certainty... but it is finer to be <strong>possessed of ideas</strong> that are as noble as they are fine.&quot; (Borowski in Etude 1919)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One did not go to hear Chopin or Beethoven as played by Rachmaninoff. One went to hear Rachmaninoff play Choipn or Beethoven.&quot; (Seroff 1970, 186)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr. Rakhmaninov lives much within himself, wears no surface-moods and emotions, cultivates no manner for audiences, shuts himself from the world except so far as <strong>his music and his playing may reveal him</strong>.&quot; (H.T. Parker in Bertensson 1956, 216)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Even critics who were negative overall noted the structural mastery of his interpretations, &quot;the <strong>intellectual grasp of the musical ideas</strong>, and the sense of the relative importance in phrase-groupings&quot; (J. G. Huneker in Bertensson 1956, 217)</p>

<h3>Rachmaninoff&#39;s art of interpretation</h3>

<p>Drawing on sources represented at the Library of Congress along with digital and print reproductions, this 2022 research identified the following written insights into the art of interpretation.</p>

<p>Emphasis is added to distill ideas. Explanantory comments in italics follow some quotes.</p>

<h6>Direct quotes by Rachmaninoff (articles • interviews • letters)</h6>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;unless the student can form some idea of the work in its larger proportions his finished performance may resemble a kind&nbsp;of musical patchwork.<strong> Behind every composition is the architectural plan of the composer. </strong>The student should endeavor, first of all, to discover this plan,&nbsp;and then he should build in the manner in which the composer would have had him build.&quot;(Rachmaninoff 1913, 208)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;one illustration of points which <strong>must be learned by the student for himself, through hearing, imitating, and inwardly perceiving the composer&#39;s meaning</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“The student must see, first of all, the main points of musical relationship in a composition. <strong>He must understand what it is that gives the work unity, cohesion, force, or grace, and must know how to bring out these elements.</strong>” (Rachmaninoff, 1913)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;One must play a piece a thousands times, making a thousand experiments, listening, comparing, judging effects. One must perceive</strong> – &quot;Yes! It sounds better if I move my arm <em>so</em>, here, or lift my finger <em>so</em> there.&quot; Or– &quot;<em>So</em> it must be!&quot; <strong>For only as the individual learns to decide and to control his musical effects does he become an interpreter and come near to the stature of the composer whose works he would re-create. And only through unceasing labor can he accomplish such a mission.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1932, 240).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>there is something quite as important as the notes, and that is the soul</strong>” (Rachmaninoff 1913)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“As the talented student grows older he must <strong>seek within himself his interpretation</strong>… He must feel it himself!” (Rachmaninoff 1932)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>“when the performer finds the same joy that the composer found at the moment the composition came into existence”</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Too few students realize that there is <strong>continual and marvelous opportunity for contrast in playing</strong>, Every piece is a piece unto itself. It should, therefore, have <strong>its own peculiar interpretation</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 213)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As a special message to students, to every one, in fact, I would say, &#39;Work! Work!&#39;&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1932, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Certain <em>general</em> ideas about interpretation can always be a guide to the student. These ideas are <strong>broad in principle</strong> and thus differ from those <strong>finer shades of interpretation which are and must be individual</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Let them paint for themselves what it most suggests.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Bertensson 1956, 218) <em>Regarding the imagery inspiring a composition. Rachmaninoff often refrained from revealing the program of his compositions to avoid limiting the listener&#39;s appreciation.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To return to the student, however much he depends on the instruction he has received, and however much he relies on his own individual interpretation, <em>he</em> must know, before he goes onto the stage, exactly what he intends to do. It happens to some artists that they never know beforehand how they are going to play at a given time. But it is better if one can know, and <strong><em>the student</em> should strive for this certainty</strong>, should leave nothing to chance, <strong>should neglect no detail</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1932, 240) <em>The remainder of this article makes clear that Rachmaninoff is not arguing for lifeless, predefined interpretations (he emphasizes the immediate, in the moment, reactions that must underly dynamics and rubato). Instead, it appears Rachmaninoff is urging the student to study hard, to know every facet of the composition, and have explored and prepared effective interpretive pathways.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>It takes years of work to understand and think out problems in music. Every player must ponder them and decide them for himself</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239) <em>Links to Rachmaninoff&#39;s earlier comment about the impact of</em> <strong>&quot;deep thought away from keyboard&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When I conduct, I experience much the same feeling as when I drive my car – an inner calm that gives me complete mastery of myself and of the forces, musical or mechanical, at my disposal&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Bertensson 1956, 222).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“any good pianist, any truly subtle pianist, has the right to his own interpretation, putting his individuality into the piece he performs. <strong>I bring out my own feelings through the tempo, phrasing and dynamic nuances of the music itself</strong>, and this gives a general idea of my concept. But any great pianist can play my piano pieces in <strong>separate details of nuances and shades,</strong> not at all in the way that I would do it myself; and yet, on the whole, the concept of the piece will not suffer, because the good taste and musical sense of the true performer will prevent it. Sometimes it is extremely interesting to watch how a pianist gives a piece you have written a completely different sound or <strong>interprets it from a completely different angle</strong> than you yourself.” (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 78)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;music should express... should become a generalization of the composer&#39;s entire life experience&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 10)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>To appreciate good music, one must be mentally alert and emotionally receptive.</strong> You can&#39;t be that when you are sitting at home with your feet on a chair. No — <strong>listening to music is more strenuous than that. Music is like poetry; it is a passion and a problem.</strong> You can&#39;t enjoy and understand it merely by sitting still and letting it soak into your ears.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1931). <em>Hints at the depth and intensity with which Rachmaninoff listened as interpreting, composing, conducting...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Avoid tendency to play chords unevenly or arpeggiously, losing <strong>evenness of movement</strong>. The difficulty of the first part is to <strong>keep the movement uniform&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65) <em>On his Prelude in C-Sharp Minor. Rachmaninoff characteristically works to maintain momentum.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One cannot soar to the heights of art like an angel; <strong>you need to climb up the hill</strong>. But the difference lies in the fact that a great artist usually forgets about the difficulties, so much his <strong>enthusiasm and love for what he does hide his hard work</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 90)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I respect the <strong>artistic searches of the composer</strong>... if he comes to modern music as a result of <strong>preliminary intensive preparation</strong>...&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 11)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Chopin still remains at the zenith. His refined sense of <strong>sound colors</strong>, his magnificent harmonies, and always truly pianistic displays of the possibilities of the instrument make his works a kind of bible for the pianist. If you know the work of Chopin, you know practically everything that can be done in the field of creating pianistic effects of high artistic value. Chopin&#39;s compositions are so handy that most students don&#39;t seem to realize that they should be <strong>studied with patience and diligence. Patience, patience and more patience</strong> is a great boon for the student who would like to achieve a complete performance. The works of Chopin must be studied with the same patience, with the same thoroughness, as the works of Bach, the great artist, genius, <strong>every note weighty&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 91)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>There is no way to put limits on the art of piano composition. Much more can be done. This is a captivating area; there will be many more explorers who will open up marvelous vistas</strong>, like those found by Chopin, rather than the terrible and repulsive abysses, as seen in the work of some modern futurists. The element of contrast is one of the strongest in art. It is inconceivable without light and shadow. Expressive dissonance is beautiful, but never-ending cacophony, taken to ruthless extremes, is never and can never become art.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 92)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Chopin had to devise a contrast for his second section... <strong>In the idea of contrast, then, is to be found the clue to the interpretation.</strong> It must be wholly different from the first section, in tone, in dynamics, in feeling&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sonata...wild and infinitely long... In such dimensions, I was lured by the program... rather, <strong>one guiding idea</strong>.... it starts to come to my mind... if I opened the program, the sonata would become clearer&quot; (lit ht v1 p9) <em>Rachmaninoff writes to a felllow composer on his sonata in progress, demonstrating his concern with and search for coherence, logic, and design thats enable audiences to comprehend and appreciate.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Notice especially that the melody in the coda is centered in the middle voicing of the right and left hand chords. These sounds need to be slightly accentuated.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65) <em>Pursues clarity and continuity by following the melody.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The repetition of the first part in doubled octaves requires the pianist to <strong>exert all his strength</strong>. The student must be <strong>warned against mistaking rage for breadth and majesty</strong>... three times slower... above all, keep an eye on the regularity of the decrescendo.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65) <em>Links to concept of culminating point — techniques of creating climax.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The pianist must match the tempo to his technical ability. To highlight a melody, one should not play faster than the performer is able to do it.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65) <em>Expression takes precedent.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Chords with a <strong>melody in the top voice</strong> should be played lightly by caressing the keys, and the pianist should <strong>try to sing the top voice</strong> in right hand chords.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65) <em>On his prelude in c sharp.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;there is a great temptation to thunder it. <strong>But the climax should not sound at the beginning.</strong> I marked the first three FF sounds. In the following, you will find several FFF marks. Therefore, save your strength.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65) <em>On his prelude in c sharp.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;study the structure</strong>... carefully. Its sections are very simple.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 65)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am told that some teachers lay a great deal of stress upon the necessity for the pupil learning the source of the composer’s inspiration. This is interesting, of course, and may help to stimulate a dull imagination. However, I am convinced that it would be <strong>far better for the student to depend more upon his real musical understanding.</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913, 216)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fine playing requires much <strong>deep thought</strong> away from the keyboard. <strong>The student should not feel that when the notes have been played his task is done. It is, in fact, only begun.</strong> He <strong>must make the piece a part of himself.</strong> Every note must <strong>awaken</strong> in him a kind of <strong>musical consciousness</strong> of his real artistic mission. &quot;(Rachmaninoff 1913, 219)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>&quot;How</em> the principle theme shall be brought into relief is an individual matter, but that it must be so treated is a general principle&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240) <em>Illustrates contrast between principles and individual nuance.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;While, of course, the student must play the notes, and all of the notes, in the manner and in the time in which the composer intended that they should be played, <strong>his efforts should by no means stop with notes. Every individual note in a composition is important, but there is something quite as important as the notes, and that is the soul.</strong> After all, the vital spark is the soul. The soul is the source of that higher expression in music which <strong>cannot be represented in dynamic marks</strong>. The soul feels the need for the <em>crescendos</em> and <em>diminuendos</em> intuitively. <strong>The mere matter of the duration of a pause upon a note depends upon its significance, and the soul of the artistic dictates to him just how long such a pause should be held.</strong> If the student resorts to mechanical rules and depends upon them absolutely, his playing will be soulless.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 219)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The pianist is constantly called upon to exercise his judgement while he is playing&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239) <em>Listening and responding in the moment...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Real <strong>inspiration must come from within.</strong> If there is nothing within, nothing from outside can help. The best of poetry, the greatest of painting, the sublimest of nature cannot produce any worthwhile result if the divine spark of creative faculty is lacking within the artist.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 93)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rubinstein was technically marvelous, and yet he admitted making mistakes. Nevertheless, for every possible mistake he may have made, he gave, in return, ideas and musical tone pictures that would have made up for a million mistakes. When Rubinstein was <strong>over-exact his playing lost something of its wonderful charm.</strong> I remember that upon one occasion he was playing Balakireff&#39;s <em>Islamei</em> at a concert. Something distracted his attention and he apparently forgot the composition entirely; but he kept on improvising in the style of the piece, and after about four minutes the remainder of the composition came back to him and he played it to the end correctly. This annoyed him greatly and he played the next number upon the program <strong>with the greatest exactness, but, strange to say, it lost the wonderful charm</strong> of the interpretation of the piece in which his memory had failed him. Rubinstein was really incomparable, even more so perhaps because he was full of <strong>human impulse</strong> and his playing very far removed from <strong>mechanical perfection</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninioff 1913, 218-9)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When the composition was originally written the composer was unquestionably inspired; <strong>when the performer finds the same joy that the composer found at the moment the composition came into existence, then something new and different enters his playing. It seems to be stimulated and invigorated in a manner altogether marvelous. The audience realizes this instantly,</strong> and will even sometimes forgive technical imperfections if the performance is inspired.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 218)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In all good pianoforte playing there is a vital spark that seems to make each interpretation of a masterpiece — a living thing. It exists only for the moment and cannot be explained. For instance, two pianistic of equal technical ability may play the same composition. With one the playing is dull, lifeless and sapless, with the other there is something that is indescribably wonderful. His playing seems fairly to quiver with life. <strong>It commands interest and inspires the audience.</strong> What is this <strong>vital spark that brings life to mere notes?</strong> In one way it may be called the <strong>intense artistic interest</strong> of the player. It is that astonishing thing known as inspiration.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 217-8)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The <strong>pedal is the study of a lifetime. It is the most difficult branch of higher pianoforte study.</strong> Of course, one may make rules for its use, and the student should carefully study all these rules, but, at the same time, these <strong>rules may often be skilfully broken in order to produce some very charming effects.</strong> The rules represent a few known principles that are within the grasp of our musical intelligence. They may be compared with the planet upon which we live, and about which we know so much. <strong>Beyond the rules, however, is the great universe—the celestial system which only the telescopic artistic sight of the great musician can penetrate.</strong> This, Rubinstein, and some others, have done, <strong>bringing to our mundane vision undreamt-of beauties which they alone could perceive.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913, 214-5)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;It is infinitely better to create than to imitate.</strong> Before we can create, however, it is well to make ourselves familiar with the best that has preceded us. This <strong>applies not only to composition, but to pianoforte playing</strong> as well. The master pianists, Rubinstein and Liszt, were both <strong>marvelously&nbsp;broad in the scope of their knowledge. They knew the literature of the pianoforte in all its possible branches. They made themselves familiar with every possible phase of musical advancement. This is the reason for their gigantic musical prominence. Their greatness was not the hollow shell of acquired technic. THEY KNEW.</strong> Oh, for more students in these days with the genuine thirst for real musical knowledge, and not merely with the desire to make a superficial exhibition at the keyboard!&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 215-6)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The pedal has been called the <strong>soul of the piano</strong>. I never realized what this meant until I heard Anton Rubinstein, whose playing seemed so marvelous to me that it beggars description. His mastery of the pedal was nothing short of phenomenal. In the last movement of the B flat minor sonata of Chopin he produced pedal effects that can never be described, but for any one who remembers them they will always be treasured as one of the greatest of musical joys.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 214)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;An artistic interpretation is not possible if the student does not know the laws underlying the very important subject of phrasing.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913, 212)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Consequently, the student must seek to give each piece a different character. Each piece must stand apart as possessing an <strong>individual conception</strong>, and if the player fails to convey this impression to his audience, he is little better than some mechanical instrument. Josef Hofmann has the ability of investing each composition with an <strong>individual and characteristic charm</strong> that has always been very delightful to me.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 214)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[The] performer must have a strong individuality, and all of his interpretations must bear the mark of this individuality, but at the same time he should seek variety constantly.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 213)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But a knowledge of the means of defining phrases in a composition is by no means all-sufficient. Skill in executing the phrases is quite as important. <strong>The real musical feeling must exist in the mind of the composer or all the knowledge of correct phrasing he may possess will be worthless.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to conceive of fine playing that is not marked by <strong>clean, fluent, distinct, elastic technic.</strong> The technical&nbsp;ability of the performer should be of such a nature that it can be <strong>applied immediately to all the artistic demands of the composition to be interpreted.</strong> Of course, there may be individual passages which require some special technical study, but, generally speaking, technic is worthless unless the hands and the mind of the player are so trained that they can encompass the principal difficulties found in modern compositions.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 209-10)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The personality of a musician influences the audience, consciously or unconsciously, in the appreciation of music. <strong>In the enjoyment of music human hearts play a more important part than human brains.</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 93)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The mere ability to play a few pieces does not constitute musical proficiency. It is like those music boxes which possess only a few tunes. <strong>The student’s technical grasp should be all-embracing.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913, 211)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The <strong>personality of a musician</strong> has a great deal to do with it. If personality does not count, then why not listen to the phonograph or radio? Why go to concerts at all? Take one concrete example. Mr. Kreisler has a tremendous personality. <strong>He comes on the stage, he plays and conquers.</strong> Now suppose at one of his concerts he played from behind a curtain. Do you think the audience would enthuse as much as is usually the custom?&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 93)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If he has talent he will see with the eyes of talent—that wonderful force which <strong>penetrates all artistic mysteries and reveals the truths</strong> as nothing else possibly can. Then <strong>he grasps, as if by intuition, the composer’s intentions in writing the work, and, like the true interpreter, communicates</strong> these thoughts to his audience in their proper form.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 209)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If a fine musical feeling, or sensitiveness, must control the execution of the phrases, the <strong>regulation of the tempo demands a kind of musical ability no less exacting.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1913, 212)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In undertaking the study of a new composition it is highly important to gain a <strong>conception</strong> of the work as a whole. One must comprehend the main <strong>design of the composer</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 208)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The young musician must <strong>first learn the rules and gain a fundamental knowledge</strong> – as did Beethoven and Bach – of the language he is going to write in; he must know them thoroughly before he can afford to tear them down and begin to write any way he pleases—calling it &#39;modern.&#39; I have had young men come to me with their compositions, and, when I point out to them what is obviously a false note, they tell me they do not understand— that is the modern way of composing. It does not take me long to discover that they don&#39;t know the simplest, the most elementary rules of harmony — rules that the students of my time in Moscow Conservatory had masted by their second year of study. (Rachmaninoff as interviewed in Seroff 1943, 43).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the right has the melody then the left is the Kapellmeister or conductor <em>in the sense</em> of being an accompanist. <strong>It must <em>follow</em> the melody.</strong> The melody is the deciding factor.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Style varies, of course, with the depth or intensity of meaning of a composition.&quot;(Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All music which is the product of great genius and therefore contains great depth of feeling offers the most difficult of problems. To play Mozart in these days is something very difficult. These <strong>greatest compositions are the greatest test of an artist.</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240) <em>Greatest challenge in depth of interpretation, not complexity of technique.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As regards the tone of the later composers, one should not attempt to separate teh idea of tone quality from the idea of style. Tone quality alone does not determine the effects. It is important but it is only one element of <strong>style, that combination of effects which must differ with each period, with each composer.</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;While I am playing I may be stirred to greater warmth of feeling, and so play that passage <em>fortissimo</em>. But then I must keep the next passage in proportion. If I had intended to play it <em>pianissimo</em>, I must play it piano to correspond to the change from <em>forte</em> to <em>fortissimo</em>. Such matters of <strong>dynamics are always relative, and must be decided at the moment of playing.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is very difficult to learn when and how to lift and to put down the pedal. It takes much teaching of both <strong>musical and technical principles</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pedaling is so important to interpretation that Rubinstein called the pedal the <strong>soul of the piano</strong>. Here again there are few broad rules, few rules of any sort that can be given, away from the piano, without the <strong>immediate illustration in sound</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The accompaniments of the left hand for waltzes, mazurkas and the like, require very subtle treatment. <strong>To work these out musically I must hear a melody, feel it musically, must hear it singing. That is the chief thing.</strong> The accompaniments are not practiced especially; but, with the control of the hand acquired by previous practice, <strong>I adjust the supporting chords in right proportion to the melody.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;hold back a little and to make a restrained, intimate tone... may approach thus the quality which Bach had in mind&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239-40) <em>Signifiance of historical studies, understand the sound the composer would have written for.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One cannot fix upon a moment when the general <em>tempo</em> must change to a faster or slower speed. That must be decided by taste. If such a variation in <em>tempo</em> is planned by the brain alone, that is wrong. <strong><em>Rubato</em> must be determined by the heart, by feeling. If you take up a composition– I am speaking of the artist, not of the student – before you go onto the platform and plan to play fast in their measure and slow in that, you will not have a true <em>rubato</em>. For <em>rubato</em> must come from feeling.</strong> &quot;(Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Interpretation depends chiefly on talent and personality. But <strong>training must be the foundation of all interpretation</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But in these days, as then, the best way for the student to learn about <em>rubato</em> is to imitate his professor. And then he must play the passages over and over and study the effects. <strong><em>Rubato</em> must be individual</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But again it does not follow that all the romantic composer should always be played with <em>rubato</em>. Far from it! <strong>We can say only that in these compositions there is more opportunity for fluctuation of <em>tempo</em> and exaggeration of style; they suggest more elaboration, more subtleties.&quot;</strong> (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240) <em>Regarding romantic period pieces vs earlier baroque and classical styles.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is perhaps no principle which is applicable to all cases of <em>rubato</em>, unless it may be that in the classics there is no <em>rubato</em> in the sense in which it is found in Chopin and other composers of the romantic school. <strong>Early classic music requires that the interpreter shall keep close to the original.</strong> He may not indulge in so much sentiment and <em>rubato</em> as is permitted in the later, romantic music. Indications of <em>tempo</em> and marks of expression such as <em>crescendo</em> and <em>diminuendo</em> must no be exaggerated. <strong>The music does not need such extremes of treatment.</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;as the talented student grows older he must <strong>seek within himself his interpretation</strong>. Does he wish to know how to play the <em>cantilena</em> of Beethoven or of Chopin? <strong>He must feel it himself! Talent is feeling, the feeling which each player experiences in his innermost consciousness. If the <em>heart</em> is in the interpretation, then that is talent. For these finest points of interpretation there are no fixed rules and principles.</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239) <em>Links to Rachmaninoff&#39;s student, Ruth Slenczynska&#39;s recollection about the need to make piece one&#39;s own.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Another general principle... The chief theme is, naturally, the most important one and as such must always be clearly heard. This statement may be taken as a general rule. The counterpoints are of secondary importance; yet one can <em>not</em> make a general rule from this fact and say that they should always be so subordinate in tone.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;his teacher should talk with him and play for him, letting him imitate. They should discuss <strong>phrasing, tone, <em>legato</em> and <em>staccato</em>, accent, rhythm, balance of phrases, dynamics, pedalling</strong> — all those various subjects which are necessary to the correct understanding of a composition&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the first theme or section is full of <em>fortissimo</em> effects, and <strong>Chopin had to devise a contrast</strong> for his second section&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the <strong>laws of structure — architectonics</strong> — require that the second theme shall be delicate, soft, gentle in character, not in <em>bravura</em> style&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>One must play a piece a thousand times, making a thousand experiments, listening, comparing, and judging effects</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The technic must be so great, so perfectly at command, that the composition... <strong>need not be practiced for technique but for interpretation only</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1923, 239)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>his efforts should be no means stop with notes.</strong> Every individual note in a composition is important, but there is something quite as important as the notes, and that is the soul... The soul feels the need for the <em>crescendos</em> and <em>diminuendos</em> intuitively. <strong>The mere matter of the duration of a pause upon a note depends upon its significance, and the soul of the artist dictates to him just how long such a pause should be held.</strong> If the student resorts to mechanical rules and depends upon them absolutely, his playing will be soulless... Every note must awaken in him a kind of musical consciousness of his real artistic mission.&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1913, 219)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hardship is good for a young musician,&quot; says Rachmaninoff, &quot;it gives <strong>depth to his feelings and more force to his expression</strong>.&quot; (Rachmaninoff in interview with Seroff 1943, 43)</p>
</blockquote>

<h6>Indirect quotes attributed to Rachmaninoff (interviews • reminiscences)</h6>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This <strong>culmination</strong>, depending on the actual piece, may be at the end or in the middle, it may be loud or soft; but the performer must know how to apporach it with absolute calculation, absolute precision, because if it slips by, then the whole construction crumbles, the piece becomes disjointed and scrappy and <strong>does not convey to the listener what must be conveyed.</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff as recollected by Shaginian 1957)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;roaring cascades of the last pages of Chopin&#39;s F Minor Ballade... while I waited there, the same passage sounded over and over again from the other room...&quot; (Seroff 1978, 43) <em>A recollection of Rachmaninoff</em> &quot;<strong>taking every screw apart</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Bertensson 1956)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t know something thoroughly, you can&#39;t do anything with it. This is something that I got from Mr. Rachmaninoff. I remember I played something for him and he said, &quot;You don&#39;t know that well enough to play it at the tempo you&#39;re taking.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ve been playing it for three weeks already.&quot; And he said, &quot;<strong>Three weeks! That&#39;s nothing. After three years! Working with it slowly, fast, until it is yours, and then you can present it. But that takes time.</strong>&quot;&quot; (Slenczynska recalling Rachmaninoff in Hall 2022, 2:30)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I remember how Rachmaninoff explained to me the problem of phrasing: he showed me an elastic band and stretched it slightly, then allowed it to bounce back; next, he stretched it beyond a certain point, and it snapped. He meant to say that <strong>no part of a musical line should be stretched out of proportion to the whole composition</strong>&quot; (Slenczynska 1961, 20)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Here again, one of Rachmaninoff&#39;s truisms: &quot;If you want a horse to run a mile-long race, train him to run a mile and a half; then the mile will be easy.&quot; (Slenczynska 1961, 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rachmaninoff recommended Scarlatti as an invigorating &quot;cold bath&quot; for finger technique. After I had had a ten-day vacation from the piano-forte, he put me on an exclusive diet of Scarlatti sonatas for three weeks in order to recondition my touch.&quot; (Slenczynska 1961, 28)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Once I know a passage thoroughly at a slow tempo, I take it a little faster, generally only two metronome numbers, so that the mind and hands hardly notice the change. At each playing I increase the speed by two metronome numbers until I reach a limit where I can still deliver the passage accurately but can&#39;t exceed that speed. There I stop. ... At the next practice period I start all over again from the original slow tempo, which already seems considerably easier than a few hours before. If it feels very much easier, I advance at the rate of three metronome numbers, taking care, however, that the fingers don&#39;t feel the strain. I never go beyond the point of tension; this point advances by itself, day by day, week by week, without forcing, until I reach a point far beyond the speed I need. Yet, I still start slowly every day and seldom exceed a five-number advancement rate, because the muscles would feel the strain and the foundations of the kinesthetic response that I am trying to build might be shaken. At times this way of practicing seems monotonous, but I have found that the time spent is well invested. Incidentally, <strong>I learned it from Rachmaninoff, who felt it was the only way to gain firm fingers.</strong>&quot; (Slenczynska 1961, 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rachmaninoff great believer in <strong>hard work</strong>... 9 hours a day nothing... 17 hours a day! ... wanted to have a technique approaching Hofmann&quot; (Slenczynska in Eloquence Classics 2020, 26:00)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rachmaninoff often said that it was more difficult to write a short prelude than a long concerto because in a brief composition <strong>every note has important meaning. The pianist should take care not to miss any of this meanings.</strong>&quot; (Ruth 33/2 29)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Gina Bachauer thus summarised her studies with him: <strong>Studying with Rachmaninoff was one of the greatest experiences of my life ... He was really one of the great specialists in tone, in colour. For him the sound he was producing was the greatest, most important thing. Technique and so on took a second place. The first place was colour, colour, colour.&quot;</strong> (Hayroundinoff, 2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rachmaninoff, when addressing the Philadelphia Orchestra during a rehearsal of his Symphonic Dances, said, “When I was a young man, I idolised Chaliapin. <strong>He was my ideal, and when I thought of composition I thought of song and Chaliapin.</strong>&quot; (Hayroundinoff, 2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He respects only honesty and a thorough knowledge of one&#39;s subject, and nothing irritates him more than the know-it-all attitude that results from superficial &quot;skimming.&quot;&quot; (Seroff 1943, 43)</p>

<h3>Interpretation as creation &amp; communication <br>A rich historical foundation</h3>

<p>Rachmaninoff studied during Russia&#39;s Silver Age of Art and Music in the decades at the turn of the 20th century – a unique and pivotal time where pianistic art was reaching a pinnacle of the romantic classical language. The following figures stand tall at this pinnacle, each contributing ideas that inform an understanding of Rachmaninoff&#39;s perspective of the creative role of the interpreter.</p>

<h3>Alexander Siloti</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Revealed expression through transcription • fluent in music • deep concern for tone</li>
	<li>Student and editor of Liszt &amp; Tchaikovsky</li>
	<li>Teacher, cousin, and lifelong mentor and friend of Rachmanionff</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I once brought the 14th rhapsody to play to him, telling him beforehand that <strong>I had dared to make some alterations in it, and even to omit certain passages,</strong> and that I wanted his opinion on it. After I had played it, he said: &quot;I not only acquiesce in, but thoroughly approve of what you have done, in proof whereof I give you my permission to make any alterations and omissions you wish —and this at any time, even after I am gone; for I know that what you consider necessary will not be detrimental to the music—indeed you may say in such cases that it is as <em>I</em> wished it.&quot; (Siloti, 1913) <em>An astounding response by Liszt that set Siloti free to make his interpretations moments of re-creation to bring his own ear for sound and color, balance and journey to every work his hand touched.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Your playing will never be any better than your playing ideal</strong>. … <strong>Unless your imagination permits you to see</strong> that temple in all its gorgeousness you will not be able to take the first step, no matter how great may be your technical skill. In pianoforte playing and in pianoforte study there are <strong>too many bricklayers and too few architects with vision</strong>.” (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One of the main features of A. Siloti&#39;s performing style... is <strong>defending his own interpretative principles, despite the taste stereotypes of that time.&quot;</strong> (Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He has <strong>created in the composition his own dynamic plan</strong>, while shifting accents and climaxes compared to the original text.&quot; (Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A characteristic feature of A. Siloti&#39;s revisions, which distinguished him from other transcribers of that time, is a large number of detailed explanations of the objectives given&quot; (Mariya 2021</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;His knocking the keys is elastic, not raw-boned and sharp... brushstrokes...what is more precious about Siloti is his ability to <strong>catch the spirit and individual features of the composition</strong> that recommends the virtuoso&#39;s intelligence&quot; (A review of an 1896 concert quoted in Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It seemed that Siloti has been playing concert for himself, he lived this music that conveyed his thoughts and emotions&quot; (A Times review quoted in Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This master [Siloti] imparted a very facile technic to Rachmaninoff and made him so thoroughly acquainted with the best literature of the instrument that his compositions became recognized at once as those of a thorough master of the keyboard&quot; (Cooke 1913, 207)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One of the first things that the student discovers in advanced playing is that there is no royal road to learning in music or in anything else. It is for this reason that <strong>the principal thing in all good art is the mental picture,the conception, the ideal.</strong> The reason why many students do not succeed is not that they do not work, but that they <strong>have no proper picture of what they aspire to do.</strong> They play, play, play at the keyboard, but they <strong>never think and dream away from the keyboard what their interpretation should sound like.</strong>&quot; (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When I say that I have learned by teaching, I mean that I discovered there were <strong>a great many effects in my own playing that I did instinctively and did not understand.</strong> For instance, I would play a passage for a pupil and prescribe a certain type of pedaling. The pupil would repeat, apparently going through the same mechanical process, and yet it would not be the same. Then I would have to analyze my own playing to <strong>find out the secret.</strong> This has helped me time and again in my public performances. <strong>The best performer and the best player must learn to analyze his own playing</strong>. (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>As Tchaikovsky&#39;s editor, <strong>Siloti would respond to the quality of the sound in rehearsal and make changes to the score in the moment</strong>. (Barber 2002)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How does one get playing ideals? First by hearing as much good playing as possible and then through the <strong>development of the musical imagination. Your playing will never be any better than your playing ideal.</strong> Let us suppose that you were going to build a great temple. <strong>Unless your imagination permits you to see that temple in all its gorgeousness you will not be able to take the first step, no matter how great may be your technical skill.</strong> In pianoforte playing and in pianoforte study there are <strong>too many bricklayers and too few architects with vision.&quot;</strong> (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The average student spends his time in worrying about methods, about the minutia of touch, fingering, accent and so forth—all necessary to the point of indispensability,——but by no means all in the art of playing. ... <strong>What does make a difference with the individual pianist is the playing ideal,—the mental conception of the work</strong> whether it be program, music or pure music.&quot; (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;During his life-time, he was the <strong>last link to the glorious past.</strong> A. Siloti is currently bringing back an aura of those fascinating pages&quot; (Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Extraordinary authority and power...grand architecture... there were two orchestras&quot; (A reviewer of a Siloti concerto performance in Barber 2002, xviii)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In his editions of Liszt, Siloti simplifies and clarifies, heightening the cantabile effect (Barber 2002, 25)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Liszt wrote letters of recommendation for Siloti and hardly for anyone else. (Barber 2002, 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Liszt would often tease Siloti by announcing his masterclass performances with &quot;Well, today we will finally hear some real paino playing&quot; (Liszt in Barber 2002, 19)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Siloti was inspired by Tchaikovsky&#39;s sensitivity and melodic style (Barber 2002, 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Siloti brilliant debut as a concerto soloist was an incredible feat. He took over from the scheduled pianist who canceled at the last moment and delivered an audience awing performance, despite the fact that this was his &quot;first time playing any concerto with any orchestra&quot; (Barber 2002, 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Siloti studied theory and composition with Tchaikovsky, who corrected his studies with &quot;care and minute precision&quot; (Barber 2002, 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He has also expanded the dynamic palette. He has created in the composition his own dynamic plan, while shifting accents and climaxes compared to the original text. According to the facts A. Siloti has set an interpretive and sound objective for the performer not only as an editor, but also as a teacher. This technique was especially effective unless the performer had previously used the S. Rachmaninoff&#39;s original in the repertoire. Then he had the opportunity to learn how to change the sound and ideological plan, while working out his auditory impressions using similar score.&quot; (Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Siloti&#39;s transcriptions clarified beautiful lines hidden within piece – exposing an individual angle on piece by enhancing elements that were already there but easy to obscure (Barber 2002)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“the principal thing in all good art is the mental picture, the conception, the ideal. The reason why many students do not succeed is not that they do not work, but that they have no proper picture of what they aspire to do. They play, play, play at the keyboard, but they never think and dream away from the keyboard what their interpretation should sound like.” (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But there is usually a <strong>deeper meaning</strong> than appears on the surface. The master had some special <strong>thought or experience,</strong> which influenced or <strong>compelled him to compose as he did.</strong> And <strong>the interpreter of his music should bring to it a many-sided experience of life in order to fathom its depths.</strong>&quot; (Siloti 1923b)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>When page turning for fellow Liszt student Ignaz Friedman in an orchetra reduction, Siloti started playing along and doubling lines – endearing evidence of his fluency in and enthusiasm for music. (Barber 2002, 21)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;With his revisions A. Siloti has not just allowed performers to express themselves, but also to develop a culture of sound extraction and phrasing using these compositions. To do this, he has described the pedaling in particular detail, while there was almost no pedal mentioned in original versions (a similar example is S. Rachmaninoff&#39;s Prelude gis-moll set. 32 No.12)&quot; (Mariya 2021)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Later in America as a professor at Julliad, Siloti&#39;s confident freedom of interpretation still shows in his recital programs, where nearly every work is followed by a note indicating it as a &quot;transcription&quot; or &quot;edition&quot; (see Mariya 2021).</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“During the 1830s Liszt evolved an interesting series of symbols —a kind of performer&#39;s shorthand—and some of them found their way into the 1838 Liszt transcriptions and solo recitals, piano solo texts. They tell us a great deal about the way Liszt himself played. A straight line over a group of notes meant a holding back, an oblong box a hurrying forward. It was really an attempt to capture the finer nuances of tempo rubato. …. These symbols were suppressed in the 1852 texts; Liszt probably felt that it was better to leave such subtleties to individual taste.” (Walker, 1977)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Liszt] indicated by the expression of his face the nuances he wished to have brought out in the music... I [Siloti] always knew so thoroughly what I wanted to express in each piece of music that I was able to look at Liszt&#39;s face all the time I was playing. <strong>No one else in the world could show musical phrasing as he did, merely by the expression of his face.</strong> If a pupil understood these fine shapes, so much the better for him; if not, so much the worse!&quot; (Siloti 1913, 17-18)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Liszt was well read and had a deep appreciation of Russian music (Barber 2002, 10).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Liszt as conductor... expression... eagle wings.. orchestra surge... other conductors stood nearby to help out with dangerous cues... &quot;poetic content&quot; (Barber 2002, 26)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He [Liszt] sometimes put down the baton and conducted with hand gestures alone (like Stokowski). To dramatize the difference between pianissimo and fortissimo he would crouch low over the podium for the former and raise himself to his full height for the latter, arms outstretched. <strong>The most telling signals came from his face, which registered all the emotions of the music as he tried to get the players to work as one. He also introduced tempo rubato, an almost unheard-of effect for an orchestra in the 1850s. His extant orchestral parts are filled with dynamic markings that show he strove to unfold different layers of sound simultaneously.</strong> We can hardly imagine what the orchestral players of his time would have made of such injunctions as ‘the instruments must sound like ghosts’ (Hunnenschlacht), or ‘like blasphemous mocking laughter’ (Dante Symphony), or to the double-bass players in the Dante Symphony, ‘take the E♯ high’. Lina Ramann astutely declared that ‘<strong>Liszt at the head of an orchestra is a continuation of Liszt at the piano</strong>’ (Ramann, H1880–94, i, 92). Liszt disparaged the old-fashioned Prussian Kapellmeister, whose metronomic approach led him to refer to them as ‘windmills’. In his manifesto ‘On Conducting’ (outlined in a letter to Richard Pohl, Briefe, C1893–1905, i, 142–5), he declared: ‘We are helmsmen, not oarsmen’, implying that it was the conductor’s job to set the compass and plot the course, while the players rowed the boat.&quot; (Eckhard, Mueller &amp; Walker 2001).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the soft parts he would beat time almost imperceptibly or not at all. <strong>When he came to a big crescendo he would suddenly spread out his long arms like an eagle spreading his wings, and the effect was so morally uplifting that you felt impelled to rise from your seat.</strong>&quot; (Siloti 1923b)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I can never forget how he intoned the theme of the first movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata. Those tones will remain with me for life; I can hear them now and always try to reproduce them when I play the work.&quot; (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am asked sometimes what were the distinguishing characteristics of Liszt’s playing and why was it so remarkable. I find the question somewhat difficult to answer. His piano tone was not so big; some of the rest of us had as much; but it <strong>excelled in a marvellously searching, poignant quality, the like of which I have never heard from any one else.</strong> In fact *<em>it could not be said that he merely played the piano; he played&nbsp;</em>music.<strong>* The two terms are widely different. He would sit at the very same piano which we students used to thump with our playing, a very mediocre, unreliable instrument; yet he could&nbsp;</strong>produce music from it such as we, none of us, had dreamed of.**&quot; (Siloti 1923a)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sergei Taneyev</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Music theorist, composer, and Rachmanninoff&#39;s professor of composition at Moscow Conservatory</li>
	<li>Studied with Nikolai Rubinstein &amp; Pytor Illich Tchaikovsky, edited Tchaikovsky&#39;s works and collaborated on piano duets with Siloti (Barber 2002, 5)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“Taneyev’s methods of teaching went beyond showing his students abstract formal archetypes and schemes. <strong>For him, structural patterns of musical forms were intrinsically connected with harmonic, thematic, rhythmic, and textural developments. His students not only studied various musical forms, they also learned how to practically present musical ideas and how to develop these ideas in composition and performance.</strong>” (Leikin 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“not one number is written in its final form until the outline of the whole work is prepared. It is written, you might say, concentrically, not by composing the whole out of the separate, successive parts, but by going <strong>from the whole to the details</strong>: from the opera to the acts, from the acts to the scenes, from the scenes to the separate numbers … Thus one may perceive the most important points in the drama on which the attention of the composer must be most concentrated, determine the length of scenes and numbers according to their importance, plan the modulatory scheme of the acts, define the orchestral sounds, and such like.” (Taneyev in Brown 2001)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The form of every composition is closely bound up with the material of which it is made</strong>” (Taneyev in Seroff 1970, 29)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;rare originality... pinnacle of musical Moscow, who for a long time, with unshakable authority, rightfullly occupied his high position until the end fo his days... <strong>Everyone treasured his advice and instructions</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 68)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>“Taneyev believed that the beauty of combinations of sound depends on definite laws which can be discovered and established with mathematical precision, and that he devoted his whole creative talent to the effort to discover those formulas” (Seroff 1970, 32)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Taneyev speaking was “concise, clear, to the point… [he] only said what was necessary” (Rachmaninoff in Seroff 1970, 28)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;how Sergei Ivanovich Taneyev liked to demonstrate the various stages of musical evolution... &#39;This, according to Taneyev, represents the first stage of the evolution, and this – as Sergei Ivanovich said – is the second stage&#39; (Rachmaninoff repeated the bars) – and finally, Taneyev would always end by saying, Here is the third stage!&#39; (Rachmaninoff again played the same bars.) As a living illustration of the characteristic Taneyev &#39;method of discussion,&#39; this musical joke was certainly curious. However, I must confess that I was much more impressed by the way in which Rachmaninoff had played this passage three times in succession. Though the fragments seemed exact repetitions, each was distinguished by a different &#39;breath&#39; that can be recorded neither in words nor in written notes. As far as I could then understand, the sense of Taneyefv&#39;s illustration lay in his subtle conveyance of these scarcely perceptible interpretive differences...&quot; (Bertensson 1956, 282)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sergei Zverev</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Foundational piano instructor for Siloti, Rachmaninoff, and Scriabin</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Zverev &quot;did not allow them [his pupils] to play unrhythmically— &quot;illiterately without punctuation,&quot; as he said—maintaining that in a clearly defined rhythmical approach lay the foundation of every musical structure&quot; (Seroff 1970, 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Zverev taught a &quot;relaxed and natural technique&quot; (Barber 2002, 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Encouraged and enabled development of broad musical knowledge for his pupils, providing a library of musical, artistic, and philosophical books and access to music literature and performance. Zverev&#39;s frequently held an open house for musicians of Russia that drew artists like Siloti, Arensky, Rubinstein, Tchaikovsky (Norris 1976, 5-6).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Required pupils to memorize (Seroff 1970, 38)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Anton Rubinstein</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He enthralled you by his power, and he captivated you by the elegance and grace of his playing, by his tempestuous, fiery temperament and by his warmth and charm. His <em>crescendo</em> had no limits to the growth of the power of its sonority; his <em>diminuendo</em> reached an unbelievable <em>pianissimo</em>, sounding in teh most distant corners of a huge hall. <strong>In playing, Rubinstein created,</strong> and he created inimitable and with genius. He often treated the same programme absolutely differently when he played it the second time, but, more astounding still, everything came out wonderfully on both occasions. Rubinstein&#39;s playing amazed by its simplicity. His tone was strikingly full and deep. With him the piano sounded like a whole orchestra, not only as far as the power of sound was concerned but in the variety of timbres.&quot; (Pressman in Martyn).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rubinstein gave at the Conservatory a course of lectures... <em>gratis</em> for professors, students, amateurs... He sat at the piano and played and explained. He included all the important composers... two lectures on Bach, and at the first he played the &quot;Twenty-four Preludes and Fugues&quot; of the &quot;Well Tempered Clavichord,&quot; and his audience exclaimed, &quot;<strong>But this is not dull! It is heavenly!</strong>&quot; (Rachmaninoff 1932, 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Alexander Scriabin</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Scriabin rarely keeps the same tempo for two beats in a row: This happens only in 9 measures out of 54 total (excluding the last two chords). Only once, in m. 7, does he keep the tempo steady for the three beats in a row. Everywhere else, the tempo changes every single beat... <strong>Scriabin’s tempo fluctuations are thoroughly logical. They underline rhetorically important gestures as well as essential points of the form.</strong> Scriabin delineates the Etude’s formal structure by considerable slowdowns at phrase and section endings. Furthermore, each section of this ternary form has its own line of development highlighted by tempo changes.&quot; (Leikin 2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Nikolai Rubinstein</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Nikolai Rubinstein was &quot;wholly committed to the aims of the composer&quot; and required students work with urtext scores (Barber 2002, 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike his brother Anton Rubinstein, he adjusted his demonstrations to inspire and not discourage his pupils (Siloti 1913).</p>

<hr id="sound_principles"/>

<h3>Sound principles identified in Rachmaninoff&#39;s recordings</h3>

<p>A close listening of Rachmaninoff&#39;s recordings and contrasting them with other interpretations revealed three distinctive traits that consistently enriched Rachmaninoff&#39;s recordings.</p>

<p>A shortcoming in any of these three elemnets can alter or blur the perceived design — arcs can become fragmented (lack of continuity), a texture can become one thick mass of color with no sense that it is woven of developing motifs (lack of clarity), and it can hard to distinguish returning ideas from new ideas or development (lack of contrast).</p>

<h6>Continuity</h6>

<ul>
	<li>Connects ideas and builds larger shapes, both in tone and meaning, evolving emotion to develop a sense of story.</li>
</ul>
<div class="frame">
  <iframe id="frame" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wCvwSLv4aXw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Rachmaninoff often lingers or holds onto the echo of last note of phrases, leaning into next phrase. Rachmaninoff writes that rubato “must follow the melody. The melody is the deciding factor.” (Rachmaninoff 1932 etude IDTP). He finds the unresolved note and plays it with a forward sounding touch, sustaining a thread of logic throughout the piece.</p>

<h6>Clarity</h6>

<p>Clearly defines phrases / motifs (often with dynamic &amp; rubato shaping) allowing audiences to appreciate individual ideas and how they develop.</p>

<div class="frame">
  <iframe id="frame" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAa2cG4wP_8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Slowing down to delineate phrase endings is like a speaker pausing after a paragraph. It allows listeners to orient themselves in the story as it unfolds and not feel lost in a constant onslaught of notes / new information. These recordings can have an effect of &quot;too much sound too quickly&quot; because they leave less space between ideas.</p>

</div>


<h6>Contrast</h6>

<ul>
	<li>Contrasts tone quality many times within the same thematic material, sometimes with just a tiny little fragment suddenly softer. This does so much to deepen and color.</li>
	<li>A special contrast of ideas, colors, rhythms can draw listeners into a piece, recapture attention, and make moments memorizable. Rachmaninoff wrote much about the magic of contrast:

<blockquote>“Continual and marvelous opportunity for contrast”(Rachmaninoff 1913)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The element of contrast is one of the strongest in art. It is inconceivable without light and shadow.” (Rachmaninoff in Apetian 1978, 92)</blockquote>

<h3>Rachmaninoff&#39;s score annotation markings support sound principles</h3>

<p>The Library of Congress Rachmaninoff Archive Box-Folder 22-7 contained Rachmaninoff&#39;s annotated score of his Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor.</p>

<p>Engaging with his annotations on the piano revealed compelling shapings – ones that created momentum, heightened color, and clarified the rhythmic backbone of his musical ideas. Comparing the interpretations suggested by his markings with his recorded performance uncovered a strong parallel. Not only did the markings suggest compelling interpretive ideas, but they unlocked a realization of how to approach Rachmaninoff&#39;s rhythmic and melodic sound.</p>

<p>The following illustrations are excerpts from the researcher&#39;s score where Rachmaninoff&#39;s markings have been traced with adherence to precision and color. Piano illustrations and a discussion of concepts can be found in a <a href="#lec_rec">lecture recital given April 15, 2022 at the UMaine Student Symposium.</a></p>

<h3>Markup in recording analysis</h3>

<p>Applying interpretive architecture markup to analysis of Rachmaninoff&#39;s interpretive decisions in his recordings clarified how he used pianistic techniques to render the architecture.</p>

<p>For example, the rubato speed (tight waves) and rubato slowing (rounded waves) marks point to where Rachmaninoff shaped time to keep momentum. Points of greater harmonic tension in the middle of gestures supported an expanding of time (see pink circles at m. 6, 7, and 8) while harmonic resolutions at the borders of gestures often needed a compressing of time to stop the momentum from stalling (see green circles at m. 1, 4, and 10).</p>

<h3>Application to piano repertoire</h3>

<p>The following are clips from the researcher&#39;s repertoire study scores. Applying Rachmaninoff ideas drew her attention to elements of compositional design that enabled the building of a more intricate and coherent interpretive architecture.</p>

<p>Many elements Rachmaninoff revealed were applied continually, including rubato, phrasing, relative dynamics, and coloristic contrast. Motivic development is one element among these that resulted in particularly concrete results that can be described somewhat effectively without illustration. Following are two examples from drastically different periods and styles.</p>

<p>In Ravel&#39;s &quot;Ondine&quot; from Gaspard de la Nuit (and similarly in Chopin&#39;s Grande Polonaise Brillante, Op. 22) listening to motivic development instead of surface contrast in figurations revealed broader arcs within the piece.</p>

<p>The following clip from Ravel &quot;Ondine&quot; shows the researcher&#39;s motif markup (an interchanable collection of small shapes, squares semicircles, and triangles in various fill patterns that provide a quick way to note motivic links between differently notated rhythmic patterns). Previously the researcher perceived this as three coloristic sections. Hearing this motivic development reveals this section as only part of one overarching development – enabling a more natural, continuous, and compelling rendering.</p>

<p>Perceiving the development of motives in the unfolding of a massive masterwork, even when far apart and separated by contrasting material, added a deeper layer of meaning and coherence.</p>

<p>Initially this simple two note pattern transitions quickly:</p>

<p>But upon returning, Beethoven responds differently, not shying away, pushing forward and reaching higher.</p>

<h3>Repertoire maps</h3>

<p>These are not static form maps, but dynamic diagrams illustrating the researcher&#39;s perception of the ebb and flow of tension, intensity, and arrival in each work or movement.</p>

<p>Before attempting this exercise, the researcher had engaged with the detail of each work extensively, memorizing and exploring the possibilities of realizing the score. Drawing these diagrams provided a chance to reflect on the overall span of the piece. In the context of composition, it acted as a lens through which to grasp and refine the dramatic journey through which the sound unfolds.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>This project had a marked impact on the researcher's musical conceptualization – far exceeding her expectations of how musicological research might impact performance. Her <a href="#cap_rec">capstone repertoire</a> included previously performed works. Applying Rachmaninoff's approach to interpretive architecture renewed and elevated these works, exposing more compelling musical shapes and catalyzing the building of broad interpretive arcs. A <a href="#lec_rec">lecture recital confirmed</a> their positive impact on the audience. </p>
